<p>Leeds has a train station with very frequent services to London and Manchester, both cities have large international airports.
It takes around 20 minutes to walk from the Leeds train station to the School of Mathematics.</p>

<p>There is a smaller airport close to Campus (Leeds-Bradford), connected to several cities in Europe, and where several low-cost airlines work. There is a bus that can take you from Leeds-Bradford airport to the city centre. Here is the <a haref="https://www.transdevbus.co.uk/flyer/services/a1/">timetable</a>. (There is no need to book in advance: tickets can be bought on the bus.)</p>
