    <h3> Anastasia Doikou (Heriot-Watt University): Combinatorial Drinfel'd twists & the Yang-Baxter equation</h3>
    <p>We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra subject to certain conditions. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist. The structure of braces emerges naturally in this context by requiring the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra to be a Hopf algebra and a quasi-triangular bialgebra after twisting. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar involutive set-theoretic (combinatorial) solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also introduce  rack Hopf-like algebras and obtain rack and quandle solutions of the YBE. We show that the same combinatorial twist cane be used to produce non-involutive set-theoretic solutions.</p>

    <h3>Ilaria Colazzo (University of Leeds): From Skew Braces to Set-Theoretic Solutions of the Yang–Baxter Equation</h3>
    <p>Skew braces offer a unifying lens for studying set-theoretic solutions of the Yang–Baxter equation. They connect familiar tools from group and ring theory to the combinatorial features of these solutions. In this talk I’ll give a friendly introduction to skew braces, explain their key structural ideas, and show how they can be used to build and analyse solutions—including a brief look at how simple solutions arise in this framework.</p>

    <h3>Joao Faria Martins (University of Leeds): Homotopy finite spaces, extended TQFTs, and representations of the braid and loop braid group</h3>
    <p>The Kontsevich-Quinn Finite Total Homotopy TQFT is a topological quantum field theory defined for any dimension $n$ of space and depending on the choice of a homotopy finite space $B$. (For instance, $B$ can be the classifying space of a finite group or of a finite 2-group.)</p>
    <p>In this talk, I will report on recent joint work with Tim Porter on once-extended versions of this TQFT, taking values in the symmetric monoidal bicategory of groupoids, linear profunctors, and natural transformations. The construction works for all dimensions, in particular providing (1,2,3)- and (2,3,4)-extended TQFTs whenever a homotopy finite space $B$ is given.</p>
    <p>I will show how to compute these once-extended TQFTs when $B$ is a homotopy 2-type (represented by a crossed module of groups), and then address the ensuing representations of the braid and loop braid groups.</p>

    <h3>Eric Jespers (Vrije Universiteit Brussel): Noetherian rings and the Yang-Baxter Equation</h3>
    <p>
      In this talk we  focus on the following problems and the link with set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation:
      <ol>
        <li>construct  natural classes of rings that are left Noetherian, semiprime, semisimple,</li>
        <li>determine when rings are left Noetherian,</li>
        <li>determine the structure of rings in these classes,</li>
        <li>how to recognise the original (semi)prime Noetherian order $R$ in its (semi)simple ring of fractions.</li>
      </ol>
